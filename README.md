# RRRModel
My ICT Project to initial the RRR Model, is used to import the precipitation data of a specific catchment to get the prediction of the runoff using RRR Model. 
 
This is a non-profit project for purely academic research purposes. 
 
A successful graduation design, which has been reviewed and praised by customers, has been adopted by customers. 
 
This project was written in Visual Studio using C # and adopted agile development. It was iterated three times in response to customer requirements during the project cycle.
 
Have detailed iterative development records and substantial project design documents.
 
The functional description is too academic and requires a knowledge base in civil engineering, so it is not described in detail here.
But I also provided sample data and parameter files for everyone to experience.
